》》Write a Python program that does the following:
1. Use UTF-8 encoding to read the book of the current directory. txt file, save the contents of the file to the "content" string.
2. Enter the content on the command line and save the input content to the "question" string.
3. Import the "API" package, pass the "content" string and the "question" string to the api.question() function (the order of passing is api. question(content, question)。
4. Output the string returned by the api.question() function
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4

》
```python
import api

def main():
    try:
        with open('book.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: 'book.txt' file not found in the current directory.")
        return
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while reading the file: {e}")
        return

    while True:
        question = input("Please enter your question (or type 'exit' to quit): ")
        if question.lower() == 'exit':
            break

        try:
            response = api.question(content, question)
            print(response)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while processing the question: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Make sure that the 'book.txt' file exists in the current directory before you run this program, and that there is a function called 'question' in the 'api' package. If you need to exit the program, you can type 'exit' on the command line.
